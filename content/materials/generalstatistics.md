Statistical analysis is "at the heart" performing hypothesis-driven research in the field of forest ecology and eco-physiology. 
With the ever increasing amount of available analyses techniques, clear guidance is needed to avoid common mistakes in data analysis and interpretation.
Here we provide guidance on applying general statistical analyses on both spatial and temporally specific data.
Moreover, uncertainty analyses and mixed-effect modelling frameworks are provided.

Examples (will) include:

- Variability decay
- Spatial analyses [FB]; (PCA; Spatial auto-correlation; cluster analyses)
- Mixed-effect modelling [SK]; (PSME)
- Uncertainty analysis [RP/CP]; (example TREX; tree ring uncertainties)
