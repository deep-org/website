<h3>This is why</h3>

Trees are wonderful things, or at least remarkable life forms, especially when considering their unique capability of converting atmospheric carbon into large quantities of woody tissue. Trees thus play a key role in the biosphere-atmosphere-climate feedback, as forests store ≈45% of terrestrial carbon within their woody tissue, contribute to ≈50% of terrestrial net primary production, and are a key component within the global hydrological cycle. In other words, trees can be considered as the anchor points in the earth climate system where the carbon and the hydrological cycle are coupled. There has consequently been great incentive to investigate the effect of changing temperatures and water availability on forest functioning. Particularly, tree-ring research and forest inventories have provided valuable insights into the ever changing forest ecosystem. Moreover, time series of plant ecophysiological measurements are becoming increasingly available and enhance our understanding of climate change impacts on tree functioning. 

<h3>This is how</h3>

In parallel, there is an increasing demand for the development of tools for time-series data curation and processing. Yet, although a plethora of freely available analysis techniques exist, in the form of R scripts and packages, a gap remains between their availability and implementation. Dendro-Ecological and Eco-Physiological (DEEP) tools aids in bridging this divided by providing user-friendly guidelines for commonly applied analysis techniques. The presented functionalities allow for establishing a baseline for data processing of various measurements in the field of forest ecology and tree physiology and supports comparability between case studies, facilitating robust, transparent, and reproducible large-scale syntheses of patterns.

This homepage section is an example of adding [elements](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) to the [*Blank* widget](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/widgets/).

Backgrounds can be applied to any section. Here, the *background* option is set give an *image parallax* effect.
