subtitle: 'DEEP is contributing to Q-NET'
summary: We are honoured to support the Q-NET topical groups "Online toolbox for data analysis" and "Analysing wood anatomical time series", for which we updated the DEEP toolbox with new materials addressing quantitative wood anatomy.
title: 'The DEEP toolbox is updated for Q-NET'
---

The updated **DEEP** toolbox will provide novel materials for performing analyses in the field of quantitative wood anatomy (QWA).
We performed this update to support Q-NET, a network bringing together scholars using QWA in various disciplines (more information on Q-NET can be found [here]( https://qwa-net.com/)).  
This week we will guide a topical group in discussing the need for an online toolbox for data analysis in QWA and xylogenesis research, and also co-host the session "Analysing wood anatomical time series".
We are excited to contribute and look forward to the future developments through the Q-NET workshop, and its synergies with **DEEP**.
