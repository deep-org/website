subtitle: 'Construction is being finalized'
summary: We are collating materials, finalizing the website and hitting the ground running with a workshop at ESA 2020. 
title: 'Getting ready to launch the DEEP toolbox'
---

The **DEEP** toolbox will provide materials for **D**endro-**E**cology and **E**co-**P**hysiology.
We, a group of researchers dedicated to open and reproducible science and sharing knowledge, are building this toolbox with the goal of bridging a gap between (novel) methods presented in scientific literature and their sub-sequent application. 
In the next months we will colate more and more (standardized) materials, free of charge, for your use and review. 
For now, we are hitting the ground running with a workshop at the ESA annual meeting 2020, which you can find [here](/talk/esa-2020-rpeters-cpappas/).
